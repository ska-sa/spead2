/**
 * Encapsulation of a SPEAD stream. Packets are fed in through @ref add_packet.
 * The base class does nothing with heaps; subclasses will typically override
 * @ref heap_ready and @ref stop_received to do further processing.
 *
 * A collection of partial heaps is kept. Heaps are removed from this collection
 * and passed to @ref heap_ready when
 * - They are known to be complete (a heap length header is present and all the
 *   corresponding payload has been received); or
 * - Too many heaps are live: the one with the lowest ID is aged out, even if
 *   incomplete; or
 * - @c allow_out_of_order is false and we have received a packet from the
 *   heap that is not the next expected one; or
 * - The stream is stopped.
 *
 * This class is @em not thread-safe. Almost all use cases (possibly excluding
 * testing) will derive from @ref stream.
 *
 * @internal
 *
 * The live heaps are stored in a circular queue (this has fewer pointer
 * indirections than @c std::deque).
 * When a heap is removed from the circular queue, the queue is not shifted
 * up. Instead, a hole is left. The queue thus only needs a head and not a
 * tail. When adding a new heap, any heap stored in the head position is
 * evicted. This means that heaps may be evicted before it is strictly
 * necessary from the point of view of available storage, but this prevents
 * heaps with lost packets from hanging around forever.
 *
 * A hash table is used to accelerate finding the live heap matching the
 * incoming packet. Some care is needed, because some hash table
 * implementations just take the lower bits of a number to map it to a bucket,
 * and some SPEAD streams increment cnts by a power of two, which can easily
 * lead to all heaps in the same bucket. So rather than using
 * std::unordered_map, we use a custom hash table implementation (with a
 * fixed number of buckets).
 *
 * When using multiple substreams, each substream has its own circular queue;
 * all the queues are held consecutively in a single storage allocation, but
 * each has a separate head pointer that wraps within its own portion of the
 * storage.
 *
 * Avoiding deadlocks requires a careful design with several mutexes. It's
 * governed by the requirement that @ref heap_ready may block indefinitely, and
 * this must not block other functions. Thus, several mutexes are involved:
 *   - @ref shared_state::queue_mutex: protects values only used
 *     by @ref add_packet. This may be locked for long periods.
 *   - @ref stats_mutex: protects stream statistics, and is mostly locked for
 *     writes (assuming the user is only occasionally checking the stats).
 *
 * While holding @ref stats_mutex it is illegal to lock any other mutexes.
 *
 * The public interface takes care of locking the appropriate mutexes. The
 * private member functions generally expect the caller to take locks.

 * - The queue mutex is taken

 * @ref start is called either from @ref stream::emplace_reader or from

 * is called.

 * @ref stop may be called from any thread (either user call via
 * @ref stream::stop, or I/O thread for a network stop). The destructor is
